Serialized Layer 2 execution to pass Spec Agent predicted risk charges directly into the Code Agent defense prompt, prompting targeted defenses with code and test evidence while preserving strict information partitioning. Implemented `discover_test_evidence()` in `soma_cli/verify.py` to auto-discover matching test files, extract test names via AST, execute tests, and feed real test evidence to Layer 2. Enhanced `call_graph.py` AST traversal to inspect dictionary dispatch tables, container elements, and callback arguments, eliminating false-positive orphan function warnings on CLI command handlers. Developed following strict TDD with 11 new behavioral tests across `tests/test_verification/test_adversarial_rebuttal.py`, `tests/test_cli_verify_test_harness.py`, and `tests/test_verification/test_call_graph_dispatch.py`.

**Status**: ✅ Shipped (v0.109.0)  
Resolved 9 security, architectural, and reliability defects identified during the multi-perspective Tempest review (BUG-073 through BUG-081). Prevented host API key exfiltration and SSRF by strictly rejecting network endpoint configuration from untrusted workspace configuration files (`.soma/soma.conf`). Closed command safety evasion vectors by parsing POSIX bundled short flags (`-*c`) and normalizing trailing slashes in destructive `rm` commands. Enforced fail-closed session token authentication in the MCP server. Decoupled Layer 0 Core from Layer 2 MCP by canonicalizing frontmatter parsing inside `cell_inventory.py`. Fixed Layer 1 multi-target evidence collisions in the Arbiter, non-literal default argument AST crashes, and C1 terminal control escape code sanitization. Silenced upstream `google-genai` Automatic Function Calling (AFC) advisory warnings on single-turn inference. Developed following strict TDD with 29 new behavioral tests and full regression test suite passing.

## Phase 13 — v0.110.0 ✅ Shipped

### Ambient Telemetry & Zero-Touch Evolution

Added standardized domain exception hierarchy (`WorkspaceError`, `WorkspaceNotFoundError`, `PathTraversalError`) subclassing `SomaValidationError` / `ValueError` for complete backward compatibility. Retained standalone functions as backward-compatible wrappers following the Strangler Fig migration pattern. Hardened error handling in git hook resolution by replacing bare exception blocks with explicit types (`(subprocess.SubprocessError, FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError, OSError)`). Integrated proactive `$PATH` guidance into `soma init` via `soma_cli.pathcheck.build_hint()`. Developed following strict TDD with 13 new behavioral tests and full regression verification (2,730 passing).

Wired the strongly-typed `Workspace` value object into perimeter and edge boundaries. Initialized `_canonical_workspace` as a `Workspace` instance at MCP server startup (`soma_mcp/server.py`) and re-exported `Workspace` via `soma_mcp/security.py`. Standardized all MCP tool handlers (`soma_mcp/tools.py`) to resolve and confine workspaces into `Workspace` instances, replacing manual path concatenations with direct `ws.confine_path()` and `ws.cells_dir` calls. Integrated `Workspace` instances across state-bound receipts (`soma_core/receipts.py`), including receipt issuance, verification, file content hashing, and cell inventory fingerprints. Wired `self.workspace: Workspace` into `soma_sdk.Governance` while preserving 100% backward compatibility for `.root`, `.cells_dir`, and `.metrics_dir` properties. Developed following strict TDD with 10 new behavioral tests in `tests/test_perimeter_workspace.py` and full regression verification (2,742 passing).

## Phase 17 — v0.114.0 ✅ Shipped

Removed deprecated standalone getters (`get_cells_dir`, `get_metrics_dir`, `get_signals_file`, `get_outcomes_file`), obsolete wrapper facades, legacy CLI flags (`--repo-root`, `--project-root`). Established the zero-warning test suite baseline (0 pytest warnings across 2,900+ tests). Official project-wide backwards compatibility contract begins here.

## Phase 24 — v0.121.0 ✅ Shipped

### Canonical Verification Pipeline, Fail-Closed Arbitration & Closed-Loop I->W->C
**Status**: ✅ Shipped (v0.121.0)  
Unifies all verification surfaces onto `VerificationPipeline` as the single canonical execution engine across CLI and MCP. Eliminates the split-brain architecture between `runner.py` and `pipeline.py` by converting `runner.run_layer2()` into a thin forwarding facade. Enforces fail-closed Layer 2 arbitration guarantees, real-time closed-loop repair loops (`--repair`), dynamic branch baseline discovery via `GITHUB_BASE_REF`, and cross-version Python 3.9 branch coverage resilience.

## Phase 25 — v0.122.0 ✅ Shipped

### Zero-Dependency SomaYAML, Horizontal Skill Graph, Response Projection & Lean Gateway
**Status**: ✅ Shipped (v0.122.0)  
Pure standard library recursive-descent YAML frontmatter parser (`soma_core/somayaml.py`). Skill graph, fail-closed slot resolution, typed envelopes (<150 tokens), and file-buffered handoff tickets (`soma_core/skills/`). Dual-Plane MCP Gateway decomposition (`soma_mcp/`) into Control Plane (`registry.py`), Execution Plane (`handlers/`), and lean router (`tools.py`). Response projection and secret scrubbing (`soma_mcp/projection.py`).

## Phase 25.5 — v0.123.0 ✅ Shipped

### Test Suite Consolidation & Hard Cleanse
**Status**: ✅ Shipped (v0.123.0)  
Relocated 191 test files into domain hierarchy: `tests/unit/core/`, `tests/unit/verification/`, `tests/unit/cli/`, `tests/unit/mcp/`, `tests/unit/sdk/`, and `tests/integration/`. Atomic synchronization of all 83 entries in `BUG_REGISTRY.json` and 23 entries in `CLAIM_REGISTRY.json`. Hermetic isolation fixtures in single canonical `tests/conftest.py`.

## Phase 26 — v1.0.0 ✅ Shipped

### Production GA, Documentation Portal & SemVer 2.0 Compatibility Guarantee
**Status**: ✅ Shipped (v1.0.0)  
Restructures root `README.md` into a lean documentation portal (< 200 lines) with interactive closed-loop diagram, 30-second quickstart, and comprehensive production guides (`docs/guides/mcp_gateway.md`, `docs/guides/verification_pipeline.md`, `docs/guides/cell_lifecycle.md`, `docs/guides/skill_graph.md`). Formal SemVer 2.0 Backwards Compatibility Guarantee published in `docs/project/COMPATIBILITY.md`.
