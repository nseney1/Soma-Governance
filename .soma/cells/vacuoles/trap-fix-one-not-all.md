# Refactoring Sweep: Fix One → Fix All

When fixing a pattern in one file, **grep for the same pattern across all sibling files** before closing the fix.

## Evidence

This vacuole was created after audit round 4 (2026-09-30) found the same
`id`/`domain` omission bug in `cell_create.sh` and `hgt_ribosome.py` that
had already been fixed in `cell_create_nl.py`. The fix was applied to one
file but not propagated to the other two, requiring a second audit round
to catch the gap.

## Rule

Before marking a bug fix as complete:

1. **Identify the pattern**: What specific code pattern was the bug?
2. **Search siblings**: `grep -rn '<pattern>' enzymes/ soma_mcp/ tests/`
3. **Fix all instances**: Apply the same fix to every occurrence
4. **Verify**: Run the full test suite after all instances are fixed

## Anti-patterns

- Fixing `cell_create_nl.py` but not `cell_create.sh` or `hgt_ribosome.py`
- Removing an import guard in 27/28 files
- Adding a frontmatter field to new cells but not existing cells
- Updating a function signature in the definition but not all call sites
