Every cell subdirectory under `.soma/cells/` (vacuoles, walls, membranes,
chloroplasts, plasmodesmata) must have corresponding parametrized content
coherence tests in `tests/test_rule_metadata.py`.

Evidence: Session 2026-09-30 added content coherence tests that immediately
caught 23 schema gaps in existing cells/genomes — missing `enforcement`,
`fitness`, `hypothesis`, `target_paths`, and `expiry` fields across 18 files.
The gaps existed because schema tests didn't cover those properties until now.

The fix is test coverage + CI gate, not TDD process mandate.
