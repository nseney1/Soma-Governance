## Trap: Local Green ≠ CI Green

**Pattern**: Agent runs tests locally, sees green (or dismisses a known red), and declares the fix complete without verifying the actual CI build.

**Why it's dangerous**: Failures stack. Each fix only reveals the next layer. Four distinct bugs can hide behind a single "build is red" symptom:

| Layer | What Happened | Why It Was Missed |
|:------|:-------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Test wrote to read-only directory | Agent never checked CI, assumed local = truth |
| 2 | Production file had IndentationError | Agent assumed CI failure was same bug as Layer 1 |
| 3 | CI missing pyyaml dependency | Layer 2 killed `make validate` before `make test` ran |
| 4 | Test sourced full script → 60s timeout | Layer 3 crashed collection before this test executed |

**Root cause**: The agent treated "build is red" as a single problem with a single fix, rather than a symptom that may have multiple underlying causes revealed incrementally.

### Detection

When closing a task that touches tests or CI:
1. **Check the actual CI run** — not just local pytest
2. **Read the failure log** — don't assume you know what failed
3. **After each fix, verify the next layer** — assume there's always one more
4. **Never declare victory until CI reports green on all platforms**

### Anti-patterns

- "That test has always been failing" → Did you read *why* it's failing?
- "It's a sandbox/environment issue" → Did you verify that claim against the CI log?
- "516 passed, 0 regressions" → But what does CI say?
- Fixing a test to pass locally without checking if CI runs the same test the same way

### The Rule

**A fix is not complete until the actual build is green.** Local green is necessary but not sufficient. CI is the source of truth.
