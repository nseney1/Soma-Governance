After the Phase 22 Soma Rebirth rename, multiple stale references survived:
- `scripts_dir = "$repo_dir/scripts"` in common.sh (CRITICAL — broke all hooks)
- `prism_root` variable names in soma_resolve.py and soma_mcp/tools.py  
- `.prism` directory check in cell_transfer.sh (always false after rename)
- "Installing steering rules" banners in install.sh and install.ps1

Any future rename operation must include a post-rename grep sweep.
