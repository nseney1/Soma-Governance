Subagent-generated content (documentation, rules, configs) must be verified
by the orchestrator before committing. Known failure modes:
- Absolute `file:///home/...` paths leaked from agent context (Session 2026-09-30)
- Platform-specific tool names hardcoded in multi-platform code (Session 2026-09-30)
- Hallucinated directory counts and file inventories (Session 2026-09-30)

Verify: `grep -rn '/home/' <file>` and review for platform assumptions.
