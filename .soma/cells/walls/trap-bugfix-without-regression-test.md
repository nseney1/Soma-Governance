hypothesis: "Bug fixes applied without corresponding regression tests will allow the same defect to recur, compounding fix-refix cycles"
prediction: Will fire when a commit fixes a bug (changes implementation code) but does not add or modify a test that exercises the fixed behavior

v0.81 origin: Bugs 1-3 in outcome_engine.py and sync.py were fixed without
regression tests. The telemetry path (.soma/outcomes.jsonl → .soma/evidence/outcomes.jsonl),
schema key (cells_used → cell_id), and outcome mapping (success→tp, failure→fp) were
all corrected surgically but had zero test coverage for the fixed behavior. This cell
ensures every bug fix is paired with a test proving the fix works and guarding against
regression.
