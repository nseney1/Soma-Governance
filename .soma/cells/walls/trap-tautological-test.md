Tests must exercise the function-under-test with inputs that DISTINGUISH
correct behavior from incorrect behavior. A test that passes regardless
of whether the implementation is right or wrong is worse than no test —
it inflates the pass count and creates false confidence.

Phase 3 incidents (test_critical_fixes.py, 4 tests):
1. `test_cell_promote_normalize_fitness_callable` — asserted only
   `isinstance(result, dict)`. Would pass for ANY function returning a dict.
2. `test_cell_fitness_agrees_with_shared_module` — tested with tp=0, fp=0
   where Jeffreys prior (0.5) and Laplace posterior (0.5) trivially agree.
   Masked a real divergence on all non-zero inputs.
3. `test_normalize_fitness_zero_triggers_not_promoted` — called
   `normalize_fitness()` instead of promotion logic. Asserted `score is
   None or score <= 0.5`, which passed vacuously because the `score` key
   was absent in the returned dict.
4. `test_normalize_fitness_high_triggers_preserves_data` — tested dict
   pass-through (`dict.get`), not actual normalization behavior.

Distinct from `trap-happy-path-only-tests`:
- Happy-path-only: tests the RIGHT thing but only for success cases
- Tautological: tests NOTHING meaningful — passes regardless of correctness

Detection heuristic: Tests whose only assertions are `isinstance()`,
`assertIsNotNone()`, or `assert X in Y` where X is a type/key check.
