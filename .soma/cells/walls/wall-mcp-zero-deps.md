The MCP stdio server is the primary entry point for Claude Code, Cursor, and other
non-Gemini agents. These users run `python -m soma_mcp` without installing the full
package. If soma_mcp/ imports pyyaml or any non-stdlib package, the server crashes
on first use. All external imports must be gated with try/except or avoided entirely.
