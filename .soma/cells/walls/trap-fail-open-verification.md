Verification tools MUST fail-closed: any execution error must produce a
FAIL verdict, never a PASS.

Supercell Cycle 2 incidents:
1. `branch_coverage.py:137` — when trace script crashed, `results_file` didn't
   exist, function returned `[]`, caller computed `verdict = len([]) == 0` → True
   (all branches covered). Fix: return `None` on crash, caller treats as fail.

2. `branch_coverage.py:210` — when target file wasn't in coverage report,
   `file_data is None` returned `[]` → verdict True. An untested file passed
   coverage. Fix: return `[-1]` sentinel so verdict is False.

3. `verify.py:128` — when all --files were out-of-tree, `safe_files` became `[]`,
   verification ran on nothing, exited 0 (PASS). Fix: exit 1 when explicit
   files are provided but none are in-tree.

Detection: grep for `return []` in verification functions and check if the
caller treats empty as success.
