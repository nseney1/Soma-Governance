Review finding arbitration MUST go through the deterministic arbiter, not
the orchestrator's judgment. The arbiter uses set-algebra on RiskCategory
enums — no LLM, no subjective filtering.

Supercell arbitration incident: After launching Prosecutor/Defender pairs for
Cycle 2, the orchestrator planned to manually read both reports and decide
which findings "survived." This bypasses the entire point of adversarial review
— the arbiter exists precisely to remove subjective bias from verdict computation.

Process: Prosecutor outputs → Prediction objects. Defender outputs → Claim objects.
Layer 1 tools → ToolEvidence. All three feed into arbiter.arbitrate() for a
deterministic SHIP/BLOCK/REVISE verdict.

When the arbiter lacks a needed RiskCategory, extend the enum — don't bypass
the arbiter.
