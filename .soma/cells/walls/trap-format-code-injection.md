hypothesis: Using str.format() or f-strings to inject variables into executable code templates enables code injection when inputs contain quotes or Python syntax
prediction: "Will catch .format() calls on strings that are later executed via subprocess, exec(), eval(), or written as .py files"

When generating executable code (Python scripts, shell commands) via string
formatting, all user-controlled or path-derived variables MUST be escaped
with `repr()` or `shlex.quote()` before interpolation.

Supercell S1 incident: `branch_coverage.py` used `_TRACE_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.format(
test_file=test_file)` to inject file paths directly into Python string literals.
A path containing `"); import os; os.system("id` would execute arbitrary code.

Detection: grep for `.format(` in files that also contain `subprocess.run`,
`exec(`, `eval(`, or write to `.py` files.
