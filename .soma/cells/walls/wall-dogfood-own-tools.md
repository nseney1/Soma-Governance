When performing lifecycle operations on Soma's own cells (create, promote,
demote, verify), ALWAYS use the soma CLI or MCP tools first. If the tool
doesn't support the operation, that's a feature gap — build it, don't bypass it.

Supercell dogfooding incident #1: `trap-schema-contract-drift` was manually
promoted from vacuole→wall via `mv` + `sed` instead of `soma promote --force`.
This bypassed the automated frontmatter update and exposed a missing `--force`
flag in the promote command.

Supercell dogfooding incident #2: 8 new cells were created by manually writing
files instead of using `soma create-cell` or `enzymes/cell_create_nl.py`. This
bypassed format validation and resulted in `enforcement: blocking` instead of
the correct `enforcement: gate` — a convention the tool would have enforced.

Rule: If soma doesn't have a tool for the operation, build the tool first,
then use it. The framework's own codebase is its first and most important
test environment.
