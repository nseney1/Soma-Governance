Before creating new instances of a typed artifact (cells, config files, schema
records), ALWAYS read at least one existing instance of the same type to ground
the field values and naming conventions.

Supercell enforcement incident: 5 wall cells were created with `enforcement: blocking`
instead of `enforcement: gate`. The agent assumed the value, wrote new tests that
codified the wrong value (circular self-consistency), and only the pre-existing
`test_rule_metadata.py` caught the mismatch. A 3-second `grep "enforcement"
.soma/cells/walls/*.md` would have prevented the error.

Detection: When creating N>1 instances of a type, grep existing instances first.
If the new instance's field values don't match, halt and verify.
