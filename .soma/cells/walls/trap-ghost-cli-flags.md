hypothesis: CLI flags registered in the argument parser but not consumed by the handler function create a false contract — users believe the flag does something but it is silently ignored

Every CLI flag registered in argparse MUST be consumed by the handler function.

Supercell Cycle 2 incident:
`soma_cli/cli.py:93-96` registered `--force` and `--cell` flags for `soma demote`.
However, `run_demote()` in `soma_cli/demote.py` completely ignored `args.force`
and `args.cell`. The command accepted the flags and silently did nothing.

Detection: For each subcommand parser, grep for `add_argument('--flag')` and
verify the handler function reads `args.flag` or `getattr(args, 'flag')`.

Automated check: AST parse cli.py to extract registered flags per subcommand,
then grep each handler for the corresponding attribute access.
