When modifying an enzyme that writes to a JSONL file (fitness.jsonl,
sessions_processed.jsonl, outcomes.jsonl), grep for ALL consumers of that
file and verify field names match.

Known incident: `fitness_updater.py` emitted `{triggered_at}` but
`oracle_checkpoint.py` consumed `{triggered}` — 100% of records silently
dropped, rendering the entire fitness loop inoperative.

Supercell C1 incident: `soma_mcp/tools.py` wrote outcomes to `.soma/outcomes.jsonl`
with `{cells_used: [...]}` while `lifecycle.py` read from `.soma/evidence/outcomes.jsonl`
with `{cell_id: str}` — 100% of MCP-reported outcomes silently ignored.
