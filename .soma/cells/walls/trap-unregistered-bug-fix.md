hypothesis: Bug fixes applied without a corresponding BUG_REGISTRY.json entry lose institutional memory — root cause patterns go untracked and recurring defect classes go undetected
prediction: "Will fire when a commit message contains bug-fix indicators (fix, bug, Bug-NNN) but docs/project/BUG_REGISTRY.json has no new entry in the same changeset"

v0.84 origin: Bugs 1-5 were discovered and fixed across v0.81-v0.82 but had no
centralized record beyond CHANGELOG prose. Root cause patterns (path_error,
schema_drift, silent_failure, mapping_error, dead_code) were only visible in
retrospect. This cell ensures that every bug fix is accompanied by a structured
registry entry linking the defect to its root cause category, regression test,
and affected files.

Detection: when a commit touches implementation code (enzymes/, soma_cli/,
soma_mcp/, soma_sdk/) and contains "fix", "bug", or "Bug-" in the message,
check that BUG_REGISTRY.json is also modified in the same changeset. If not,
flag for review.
