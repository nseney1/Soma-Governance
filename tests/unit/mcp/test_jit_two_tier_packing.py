"""Tests for Partitioned 2-Tier Token Budget and Atomic Directive Compression (Phase 22 / v0.119.0).

Validates:
1. Normal allocation: Tier 1 (Gates, 60% = 1200 tokens) and Tier 2 (Advisory, 40% = 800 tokens).
2. Headroom flow: Unused Tier 1 token budget flows into Tier 2 dynamic headroom.
3. Tier 1 over-subscription (>1200 tokens of gates): Tier 2 advisory rules are dropped to 0 tokens.
4. Incompressible Gate Guarantee: Under extreme gate pressure, gates are NEVER dropped;
   overflow gates compress to Atomic Invariant Directives so all gates fit within budget.
5. Tier 2 over-subscription: Advisory cells are selected strictly in descending Salience order.
