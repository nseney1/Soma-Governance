"""Behavioral tests for BUG-080: Missing CLI Output Sanitization & C1 Control Sequence Gaps.

sanitize_display() must filter 8-bit C1 control sequences (\x80-\x9f) and DCS escape
sequences. In addition, CLI error and warning streams must sanitize external inputs
(such as filenames from git or user arguments).
